#FuseR - FuseTools, ReactQL & PostGraphQL Framework

There is still much work needed to be done but at this point it's share-worthy.

>Please ensure that you have PostgreSQL running before attempting to install or otherwise use FuseR.

## Install
```bash
lerna run install

```

## Run
```bash
lerna run start
```

## Alternative operation

>Open two separate consoles and navigate to `packages/server` and `packages/client`
>Once there, you can execute manually `npm install` and `npm start` after the installation is completed.

## Documentation

>There is an extensive tutorial inside the `server/data` that will go over the specifics regarding the PostgreSQL
>and GraphQL integration that PostGraphQL provides.
