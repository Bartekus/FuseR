#fuseR - FuseTools, ReactQL & PostGraphQL Framework

There is still much work needed to be done but at this point it's share-worthy.

>Please ensure that you have PostgreSQL running before attempting to install or otherwise use fuseR.
>Also while the installation can be performed from single terminal for both client and server
>you will need to open another console as each process will require its own terminal.
>If you wish to run installation process in individual terminal you may do so by executing `npm run install-client`
>and `npm run install-server` respectively from separate terminals.
