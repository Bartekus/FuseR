# Universal React + Redux Boilerplate

This is a work-in-progress creation of a boilerplate which I’ll be using in my projects.

- [ ] React (ES5), served with a simple Koa server
- [ ] React (ES6) with JSX, transpiled and bundled with webpack and babel
- [ ] Development strategy using webpack’s development middleware
- [ ] Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in development
- [ ] Production strategy using hashes for cache invalidation
- [ ] Going universal with server-side rendering (SSR)
- [ ] Handle application state with Redux
- [ ] Linting and testing critical application code
- [ ] Routing with React Router
- [ ] Asynchronous Redux with Promises
- [ ] Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Redux

Because I want the commits in the same order as this checklist, I will rebase and force push to master as long as this is a work-in-progress. You’re warned!
